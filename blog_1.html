                                    <h2>Leadership and Management</h2>
                                    <p>Leaders are not born, rather they are prepared. And the most important skills in today’s scenario are
                                        leadership and management. In fact, these cannot be taught unless experienced and practiced. One
                                        is just introduced to the concept. And then one can learn it by oneself. You just need to have an
                                        inspiration. Because it is force that pushes you from inside and inculcates in you the zeal to work on
                                        yourself. <br>
                                        Being a great leader and manager is one of the most important skill to be developed in oneself, so as
                                        to cop up with the ups and down of the life. The Leadership and Management are two different
                                        things to be acquired. Whatever may be the state-space, you will have to do your part and yes, the
                                        truth is everything happens for a reason. Though the happening may be good or bad, but the
                                        outcome to come will always be good. Just be focused on your path. But remember to do your part
                                        In the era of competition and comparison, keep moving ahead accepting what you are. But
                                        remember to do your part. One has all the skills in oneself, but in the race of comparing and
                                        competing with others, you lose the essence. If you compare, remember to take it in positive way
                                        and work on yourself. Nobody can stop you from achieving what you deserve. Be a motivator for
                                        yourself. Be your own leader and manager. Starting your day-to-day task with an attitude of
                                        gratitude can help you much. Some don’t even have what you have, so be thankful for that. Neither
                                        over-confidence nor low-confidence but the self-confidence matters. You are the leader of your own
                                        self.
                                       
                                         </p>
                                        
                                </div>
                               
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                                    If you learn to replace I can’t with I can, you can achieve anything.
                                    And another thing to focus on, is the power of self-belief. Even in DON’T QUIT, there is DO-IT. It’s
                                    just a matter of perception. So even if you have the right attitude you can do it. You can, you should
                                    and you must no matters what comes and goes. Keep your mind focused and well-directed, as the
                                    saying is God helps those who helps themselves.
                                    How to become a great leader. <br>
                                    What do you think leadership is- A title? A position? A degree? No that’s just the fancy words to be
                                    used. It’s not the position you hold that makes you a great leader. In fact, what makes you a leader
                                    are qualities and skills you possess. You should have the capability to handle the responsibility. Are
                                    you capable? Are you able? And if you are, then you can be the leader. The physical disability can be
                                    managed via some artificial means, but if you are intellectually disabled, that is going to be too hard
                                    for it. Even if you keep reciting a lie a 100 hundred times, if is going to feel like truth.
                                    Leadership is all about producing more than consuming and giving more than taking. The leader is
                                    not one who seeks for an opportunity, but he is the one who creates it and not only for himself but
                                    also for others. To be a leader one should be an intelligent and dynamic in nature. Try to apply the
                                    things you learn. An intelligent person can be found, but what is hard is to find a dynamic person.
                                    Plan-out your work and try to work it out. Your education is just an indication of your intelligence,
                                    but the way you make your way out of the problem makes you super-intelligent. Direction and
                                    action matter a lot. Everyone is aware of the action; things change when you are aware of the
                                    direction. Being intelligent or not, is a different thing. One should never have ego. To abstain from
                                    tit, one should have a mentor. Success after success might make you arrogant and greedy for the
                                    power. And that’s the moment where a mentor plays a role. To guide you, you mind you, so that you
                                    may have a way out. No matter at what height you reach, you can never be stable without a sole
                                    mentor. <br>
                                    Develop the quality of investigating a problem and find the way out of it with a proper strategy.
                                    Taking a right decision needs investigation about the task. Your life is not all about trials and
                                    experiments, rather it is all about commitment. Instead of taking the life as a battle, take it as a
                                    game. And you will surely enjoy it if you play it along with others. <br>
                                    Another thing to be considered is to be in contact of your known ones. Never forget them. Your
                                    relations, your acquaintances will still matter, no matter where you reach in your life. It should not
                                    have to be like this that on reaching on heights, you look around yourself and you observe that while
                                    running forward you left all behind and that too far. <br>
                                    A leader is one who has the attitude of gratitude. He always remembers that whatever is he on day,
                                    that is not only because of himself only. It was all due to the help and blessings of others.
                                    Nevertheless, that can’t be paid back, he tries to pay back by helping others, mentoring others, and
                                    much more. Leader pays off the society by providing more leaders, setting up an example for others.

                                <h3>MANAGEMENT</h3>

                                Leadership and Management go hand-in-hand. Management is dealing with the management of
                                time, study, tasks, your resources, your relationships.
                                Management basically takes the fives calibers. <br>
                                <b>The power to undertake-</b> Leader takes the opportunity to initiate the task. And then by time, others
                                join to help you. <br>
                                <b>The excellence of men and material-</b> It is never about the efficient resources to begin; it’s about
                                making the existing resources efficient enough. Each and every person on this planet has got the
                                same 24-hours, but it depends on how you manage them. <br>
                                <b>The right time and place -</b> Everything just needs the right time and right space; you have to figure it.
                                Be patient giving your best. Even Taj Mahal was not built in a day. <br>
                                <b>Provision against failure -</b> One always have a back-up plain if for God sakes something happens.
                                Having a provision for the failure, entitles you to be successful.
                                <b>Accomplishment of results. -</b> Don’t just start because your have to run the race. Run to win, or at
                                least, to finish. Wining or not is another thing. Remember to do your part efficiently and with full
                                responsibility. <br>
                                Whatever you pursue, at least go for it with self-confidence with the faith to be the achiever. Never
                                underestimate yourself, because you are no less than anyone. You too have the same 24 hours, the
                                same body organs, the same intelligence and all that other people around you have. To make a
                                difference, you have to learn about managing that all. Leaders and Managers don’t come from a
                                different breed. They are just the ordinary people among us, who come out to be extraordinary with
                                time. They do it for the society and their people. They are occupied with the skills of self-confidence
                                rather than selfishness. Be a whole-hearted person. <br>
